## NOTICE

This repository contains the public FTC SDK for the SKYSTONE (2019-2020) competition season.  

Formerly this software project was hosted [here](https://github.com/ftctechnh/ftc_app).  Teams who are competing in the SKYSTONE Challenge should use this [new SKYSTONE repository](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/SKYSTONE) instead of the older (and no longer updated) ftc_app repository.
